        """Returns a slug on a name which is unique within a model's table

        This code suffers a race condition between when a unique
        slug is determined and when the object with that slug is saved.
        It's also not exactly database friendly if there is a high
        likelyhood of common slugs being attempted.

        A good usage pattern for this code would be to add a custom save()
        method to a model with a slug field along the lines of:

                from django.template.defaultfilters import slugify

                def save(self):
                    if not self.id:
                        # replace self.name with your prepopulate_from field
                        self.slug = SlugifyUniquely(self.name, self.__class__)
                super(self.__class__, self).save()
